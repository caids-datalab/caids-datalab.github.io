    "section": "Learning Objectives",
    "text": "Learning Objectives\n\nAdvanced Data Science Skills: Enhance students’ proficiency in data analysis, machine learning, statistical analysis and best practices following FAIR principles.\nPractical Application: Provide hands-on experience with real-world data sets and case studies.\nCollaborative Learning: Foster collaboration among students, developers, professors, and industry professionals.\nKnowledge Transfer: Enable students to effectively transfer their knowledge to their peers through workshops and tutorials.\nProfessional Development: Prepare students for careers in academia, industry, and research by enhancing their technical and soft skills.\n\n\nSPARK Boot-camp\nThe SPARK Boot-camp is an in-person training program designed to equip graduate students with data science and computational skills, from beginner to advanced levels. The program invites graduate students to participate in a one or two-week course (depending on schedule), where they will receive intensive training from experienced professors and senior graduate students from Tulane. The content of the course will range from introductory data science with R and Python to advanced topics in machine learning and AI.\n\nParticipants\nParticipants will gain practical experience in data science by working with common datasets such as the Cars and Palmer Penguins, as well as their own research data. Each scientific field and its associated data present unique challenges. By engaging with datasets relevant to their interests, participants not only enhance their learning but also produce valuable deliverables that contribute to their research endeavors.\n\n\nInstructors\nThis training course is led by a professor at Tulane and a senior graduate student. Professors are encouraged to propose a one or two week summer course their topic of interest or expertise. Senior graduate students are invited to propose a summer course jointly with faculty and participate as a teaching assistant or instructor of record. This presents a great opportunity to advance professional development and career goals.\n\n\nBoot-camp Application and Selection Criteria\n\nParticipants\n\nEligibility: Open to graduate students for all departments. Register like any other course. Limited seats available. ##### Instructors\nEligibility: Open to professors and senior graduate students from all departments that use or apply computational and data science concepts in research and knowledge development.\n\nProfessors:\n\nSubmit a proposal for a one or two week boot-camp. Use the [[#Boot-camp proposal guidelines]].\n\nSenior graduate students:\n\nSubmit a proposal for a one or two week boot-camp. Use the following guidelines (Guidelines under development).\nCollaborate with professor to develop boot-camp curriculum and establish if your participation will be as a research assistant or instructor of record.\n\n\n\n\n\nBoot-camp deliverables and logistics\nDeliverables: These need to be presented withing the initial proposal. Documentation of these deliverables can serve as reference for future boot-camp applicants. - Comprehensive lesson plan - Budget and use of resource plan - Interactive exercises and case studies - Assessment tools (quizzes, projects) - Workshop materials (slides, handouts, code samples) Logistics: - Scheduling workshops in collaboration with SAC (Student Activities Council) and DRI (Data Research Institute) - Securing venues and necessary equipment - Marketing and promotion of workshops - Maybe be part of Data Week and Love Data Week - Knowledge Exchange participants being part of either of these. - Managing registrations and attendance\n\n\n\nBoot-camp Proposal Guidelines\n\nGeneral Plan Requirements\n\nStructure: Clear objectives, step-by-step instructions, and expected outcomes\nContent: Relevant theoretical background, practical exercises, and real-world applications\nEngagement: Interactive components such as discussions, group work, and hands-on activities\nEvaluation: Methods to assess participants’ understanding and skills ##### Proposal Selection criteria Boot-camp course proposals will be reviewed by members of the Connolly Alexander Institute for Data Science (comprised of students, faculty, and staff) and selected for funding according to the following criteria:\n\n\nThe boot-camp course must clearly demonstrate collaboration between students, faculty, and staff.\nThe boot-camp course must support the mission of CAIDS.\nThe boot-camp course must demonstrate a clear benefit to the College community and provide opportunity for co-curricular learning that occurs outside of the traditional classroom.\nThe budget should be planned as a cost-effective use of grant funds and other Tulane resources and should not duplicate existing activities or programs.\nThe boot-camp course must be a new topic or an expansion of an existing course or topic series. Priority will be given to new and innovative topics that focus on partnership building (on-campus and/or off-campus) and creative collaboration.\n\n\n\n\n\nSPARK Knowledge Exchange\nThere are numerous courses, boot camps, and seminars dedicated to teaching data science and related fields. The Knowledge Exchange pathway aims to support graduate students by providing funding to participate in external training programs, seminars, conferences or similar events and subsequently share that knowledge at Tulane. The application process requires 1) a statement of interest explaining the event and its relevance to their research and career goals, 2) a CV/Resume, and 3) a brief proposal for a workshop or tutorial they plan to deliver upon their return. After completing their training, participants must present their acquired knowledge through a one-hour in-person or online workshop, a written tutorial, or a vignette to be included in the CAIDS GitHub repository for future reference. For training that requires access to code, participants are encouraged to share the source code on CAIDS GitHub as long as it is public or original authors provide permission to share.\nThe funding provided by this program can be use to cover conference registration and add-ons (e.g. special workshop at conference not included in initial fees). ##### Ways to share knowledge\nSome ways of sharing participants’ newly acquired skills could be: - Organizing and presenting a workshop with student organizations (undergraduate or graduate), for example: - Tulanians Who Enjoy R coding (TWERC) - SACNAS chapter - Cookies and Code - - Film Screenings - Online tutorial or vignettes\n\nKnowledge Exchange Application and Selection Criteria\n\nEligibility: Open to graduate students from all departments.\nApplication Materials:\n\nStatement of interest, .\nCV/Resume,\nbrief proposal for a workshop or tutorial they plan to deliver.\n\nSelection Criteria: Research interests and professional development needs, relevance of the proposed workshop, and the potential impact on their home institution.\n\n\n\nKnowledge Exchange Deliverables\nDeliverables: - One-hour workshop (in-person or virtual) - Tutorial or vignette (e.g. how to import and visualize data) in Markdown format - Proposal for workshop - Some of the topics that Knowledge exchange participants can participate lend themselves to elaborate deeper and could be developed as a one or two-week boot-camp. We invitie participants to explore this possibility. - If this deliverable is chosen, see [[#Boot-camp Application and Selection Criteria]].\n\n\n\nGraduate Summer Research Grants \nThe Connolly Alexander Institute for Data Science (CAIDS) invites Tulane University PhD and other doctoral students to submit applications for Summer Grants of up to $2000. Please note: Applications that request funds for data collection or data acquisition (see eligibility criteria 4 below) are eligible to apply for up to $5000.\nSee further details HERE. #### Graduate Summer Research Grants Application and Selection Criteria To be eligible, applicants must:\n\nhave advanced to doctoral candidacy, scheduled to defend their dissertation prospectus in Spring 2024, or have completed all coursework and begun research for their dissertation (or the equivalent) and\nfocus on or use data in their dissertations (or the equivalent).\n\nPreference will be given to applications that request funds for data collection or access (see eligibility criteria 4 below), undergraduate research support, or expenses related to working with community partners. \nCAIDS defines “data” broadly, including not only quantitative data but also qualitative data, such as data obtained from interviews.\nSee further details HERE.\n\nGraduate Summer Research Grants Deliverables\nGrant recipients must submit a progress report to Meg Keenan at mkeean@tulane.edu by October 31, 2024.

    "text": "The Data Ambassador Council (DAC) is a diverse cohort of undergraduate an graduate students that engage and have an input at CAIDS by solving problems regarding data programming. The first DAC cohort undertook the objective of supporting CAIDS annual objective of “getting the word out about CAIDS”. To address this DAC developed promotional products (e.g. sticker), social media and in-person strategies to increase CAIDS presence at Tulane University.\nThe DAC developed social media presence by creating digital media and product with CAIDS brand, as well as slogans regarding data science and data literacy. The DAC team comprised of 10 undergraduate students, 1 graduate student and 1 graduate student serving as Data Lab Manager/Product Developer. The team meet bi-weekly starting in January 2024 until April 29th 2024. In the absence of a CAIDS communications liaison to enact the social media campaigns developed by DAC, the Data Lab Manager and DAC members assumed the responsibility. Since DAC assumed social media responsibilities, Facebook and Instagram posts’ engagement increased by 150% and 145.6% respectively (see Section 4 section).\nThe main event organized was a tabling event on April 3 at McAlister Booths. The objective of the tabling event was to bring visibility to DAC and CAIDS events and course offering while collecting names and emails for a future list-serve and newsletter data base. This event required the development of stickers with CAIDS branding (e.g., “Data Equity” @tulanecaids, see below) and flyers advertising CAIDS’ Fall 2024 course offerings. It was a success with over 50 people stopping by the table and providing their information. The same digital media used for flyers was used on social media platforms (Facebook, Instagram and X). All digital media is stored in the Data Lab’s Canva account and Google Drive folder.\nThe following report aims to summarize and reflect on the Data Lab’s inaugural cohort of Data Ambassador Council (DAC) during Spring 2024. The DAC cohort was led by Dr. Jacquelyne Thoni-Howard, Ph. D. as the Data Lab Director and Bolívar Aponte Rolón as the Data Lab Manager."

Prioritize flexibility of the team and functionality of the product. Document changes, make a new plan, and implement.\nSometimes we have to do the difficult time consuming work instead of finding a trendy workaround.\nConsidering the user and client’s needs when researching and developing.\n\nTeam Value #2: Connecting to the personal and to communities outside of academia and Uncovering the causes of inequality and leveraging resources toward undoing power structures\n\nSeeing the Reciprocal Exchanges in collaboration and in partnership.\nFocus on the client’s needs, abilities, and sustainability when designing projects.\nTake care in your work by not speeding through tasks and starting projects last minute. See discussion, research and trial and error as part of the process.\nDocument for the future in clear and simple terms as essential work.\nSee the importance and bigger picture of the work that you are being trusted and asked to do.\n\nTeam Value #3: Treating students as agentic co-educators and promoting cooperative learning\n\nCollaborative, interdisciplinary, student-led (bottom up management approach).\nEveryone has something to contribute and equal voice on the team.\nEveryone works on and knows about all of the projects.\nKeep up active cross team, cohort, and client communication channels through documentation (GitHub, skills manuals, product backlogs).\nWork in pairs and talk about work as much as possible\n\nTeam Value #4: Building equity, trust, mutual respect, and support\n\nPull together to get the work done.\nSupport each other when working on challenging materials.\nHold each other accountable for showing up ready to work.\nListen and take away important information from meetings.\nRead the cards before the meeting.\nShow/Demonstrate your work.
