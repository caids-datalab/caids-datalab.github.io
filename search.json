    "text": "The Data Ambassador Council (DAC) is a diverse cohort of undergraduate an graduate students that engage and have an input at CAIDS by solving problems regarding data programming. The first DAC cohort undertook the objective of supporting CAIDS annual objective of “getting the word out about CAIDS”. To address this DAC developed promotional products (e.g. sticker), social media and in-person strategies to increase CAIDS presence at Tulane University.\nThe DAC developed social media presence by creating digital media and product with CAIDS brand, as well as slogans regarding data science and data literacy. The DAC team comprised of 10 undergraduate students, 1 graduate student and 1 graduate student serving as Data Lab Manager/Product Developer. The team meet bi-weekly starting in January 2024 until April 29th 2024. In the absence of a CAIDS communications liaison to enact the social media campaigns developed by DAC, the Data Lab Manager and DAC members assumed the responsibility. Since DAC assumed social media responsibilities, Facebook and Instagram posts’ engagement increased by 150% and 145.6% respectively (see Section 4 section).\nThe main event organized was a tabling event on April 3 at McAlister Booths. The objective of the tabling event was to bring visibility to DAC and CAIDS events and course offering while collecting names and emails for a future list-serve and newsletter data base. This event required the development of stickers with CAIDS branding (e.g., “Data Equity” @tulanecaids, see below) and flyers advertising CAIDS’ Fall 2024 course offerings. It was a success with over 50 people stopping by the table and providing their information. The same digital media used for flyers was used on social media platforms (Facebook, Instagram and X). All digital media is stored in the Data Lab’s Canva account and Google Drive folder.\nThe following report aims to summarize and reflect on the Data Lab’s inaugural cohort of Data Ambassador Council (DAC) during Spring 2024. The DAC cohort was led by Dr. Jacquelyne Thoni-Howard, Ph. D. as the Data Lab Director and Bolívar Aponte Rolón as the Data Lab Manager."

It is living your values.” - Adam Grant\n\nGoals: Share work, delegate, collectively problem solve, forward-facing/open communications, do not hide, transparent/documentation, boundaries/self-care, take on realistic work, no blame/ take accountability, allow yourself to take risks, must document help tickets,\nTeam Value #1: Using technology intentionally to build communities and enhance learning and Examining the “why” in addition to the “what.”\n\nScrum - Individual needs and Interactions over processes and tools. (Software)\nCenter the client’s needs including project sustainability and the intern’s voices in doing that work.\nActive communication by eliminating information silos.\nRespond to change over following the plan. Prioritize flexibility of the team and functionality of the product. Document changes, make a new plan, and implement.\nSometimes we have to do the difficult time consuming work instead of finding a trendy workaround.\nConsidering the user and client’s needs when researching and developing.\n\nTeam Value #2: Connecting to the personal and to communities outside of academia and Uncovering the causes of inequality and leveraging resources toward undoing power structures\n\nSeeing the Reciprocal Exchanges in collaboration and in partnership.\nFocus on the client’s needs, abilities, and sustainability when designing projects.\nTake care in your work by not speeding through tasks and starting projects last minute. See discussion, research and trial and error as part of the process.\nDocument for the future in clear and simple terms as essential work.\nSee the importance and bigger picture of the work that you are being trusted and asked to do.\n\nTeam Value #3: Treating students as agentic co-educators and promoting cooperative learning\n\nCollaborative, interdisciplinary, student-led (bottom up management approach).\nEveryone has something to contribute and equal voice on the team.\nEveryone works on and knows about all of the projects.\nKeep up active cross team, cohort, and client communication channels through documentation (GitHub, skills manuals, product backlogs).\nWork in pairs and talk about work as much as possible\n\nTeam Value #4: Building equity, trust, mutual respect, and support\n\nPull together to get the work done.\nSupport each other when working on challenging materials.\nHold each other accountable for showing up ready to work.\nListen and take away important information from meetings.\nRead the cards before the meeting.\nShow/Demonstrate your work. Interns will never be in trouble by showing that they tried or by communicating problems early.\n\nTeam Value #5: Cultivating self-care and boundaries\n\nIf sick or overwhelmed, proactively communicate with Jacque and make a plan. Do not come to work sick.\nLook at the week ahead before scrum and be realistic about the work you can take on.\nCommunicate through proper channels especially when stuck.\nGive each other time to respond.\nDo not work off the clock.\nWhile Devs may ask questions when they are on shifts, the PDs will answer those questions asked in slack during their assigned slack office hours.\n\nTeam Value 6: Examining how gender, intersecting with other social categories, structures our lives, learning, and knowledge production, access to resources and information.\n\nReadings and curriculum in Technology Studies\nZine\nTechnology Showcase"
